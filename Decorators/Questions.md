1. Timing Function Execution
--> Write a decorator that measures the time a function takes to execute.

2. Debugging Function Calls
--> Create a decorator to print the function name and the values of its arguments every time the fuction is called.

3. Cache Return Values
--> Implement a decorator that caches the return values of a function, so that when it's called with the same arguments, the cached value is returned instead of re-executing the function.
