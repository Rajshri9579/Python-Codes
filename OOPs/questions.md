1. Basic Class amd Object
--> Create a Car class with attributes like brand and model. Then create an instance of this class. 

2. Class Method and Self
--> Add a method to the Car class that displays the full name of the car(brand and model).

3. Inheritance
--> Create an ElectricCar class that inheruts from the Car class and has an additional attribute battery_size.

4. Encapsulation
--> Modify the Car class to encapsulate the brand attribute, making it private, and provide a getter.

5. Polymorphism
--> Demonstrate polymorphism by defining a mr=ethod fuel_type in both Car and ElectricCar classes, but with different behaviors.

6. Class Variables
--> Add a class variable to Car that keeps track of the number of cars created.

7. Static Method
--> Add a static method to the Car class that returns a general description.

8. Property Decorator
--> Use a property decorator in the Car class to make the model attribute read-only.

9. Class Inheritance and isinstance() Function.
--> Demonstrate the use of isinstance() to check if my_tesla is an instance of Car and ElectricCar.

10. Multiple Inheritance
--> Create two classes Battery and Engine, amd let the ElectricCar class inherit from both, demonstrating multiple inheritance.
